# a simple  way to create a list of even  number using list_comprehensions

even_numbers = [i for i in range(1,100) if i%2==0]
print even_numbers

# a primitive way of writing the same above is
even_numbers=[]
for i in range(1, 100):
    if i%2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(i)
print even_numbers
